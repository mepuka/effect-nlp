# Use the Auto-Generated .Default Layer in Tests

## Guideline

In your tests, provide service dependencies using the static `.Default` property that `Effect.Service` automatically attaches to your service class.

## Rationale

The `.Default` layer is the canonical way to provide a service in a test environment. It's automatically created, correctly scoped, and handles resolving any transitive dependencies, making tests cleaner and more robust.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

// Define MyService using Effect.Service pattern
class MyService extends Effect.Service<MyService>()(
  "MyService",
  {
    sync: () => ({
      doSomething: () => 
        Effect.succeed("done").pipe(
          Effect.tap(() => Effect.log("MyService did something!"))
        )
    })
  }
) {}

// Create a program that uses MyService
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.log("Getting MyService...");
  const service = yield* MyService;
  
  yield* Effect.log("Calling doSomething()...");
  const result = yield* service.doSomething();
  
  yield* Effect.log(`Result: ${result}`);
});

// Run the program with default service implementation
Effect.runPromise(
  Effect.provide(program, MyService.Default)
);
```

**Explanation:**  
This approach ensures your tests are idiomatic, maintainable, and take full advantage of Effect's dependency injection system.

## Anti-Pattern

Do not create manual layers for your service in tests (`Layer.succeed(...)`) or try to provide the service class directly. This bypasses the intended dependency injection mechanism.
