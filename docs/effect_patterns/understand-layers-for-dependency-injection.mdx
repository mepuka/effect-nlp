## Guideline

Think of a `Layer<R, E, A>` as a recipe for building a service. It's a declarative blueprint that specifies:
-   **`A` (Output)**: The service it provides (e.g., `HttpClient`).
-   **`R` (Requirements)**: The other services it needs to be built (e.g., `ConfigService`).
-   **`E` (Error)**: The errors that could occur during its construction (e.g., `ConfigError`).

---

## Rationale

In Effect, you don't create service instances directly. Instead, you define `Layer`s that describe *how* to create them. This separation of declaration from implementation is the core of Effect's powerful dependency injection (DI) system.

This approach has several key benefits:
-   **Composability:** You can combine small, focused layers into a complete application layer (`Layer.merge`, `Layer.provide`).
-   **Declarative Dependencies:** A layer's type signature explicitly documents its own dependencies, making your application's architecture clear and self-documenting.
-   **Testability:** For testing, you can easily swap a "live" layer (e.g., one that connects to a real database) with a "test" layer (one that provides mock data) without changing any of your business logic.

## Good Example

Here, we define a `Notifier` service that requires a `Logger` to be built. The `NotifierLive` layer's type signature, `Layer<Logger, never, Notifier>`, clearly documents this dependency.

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

// Define the Logger service with a default implementation
export class Logger extends Effect.Service<Logger>()(
  "Logger",
  {
    // Provide a synchronous implementation
    sync: () => ({
      log: (msg: string) => Effect.sync(() => console.log(`LOG: ${msg}`))
    })
  }
) {}

// Define the Notifier service that depends on Logger
export class Notifier extends Effect.Service<Notifier>()(
  "Notifier",
  {
    // Provide an implementation that requires Logger
    effect: Effect.gen(function* () {
      const logger = yield* Logger;
      return {
        notify: (msg: string) => logger.log(`Notifying: ${msg}`)
      };
    }),
    // Specify dependencies
    dependencies: [Logger.Default]
  }
) {}

// Create a program that uses both services
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const notifier = yield* Notifier;
  yield* notifier.notify("Hello, World!");
});

// Run the program with the default implementations
Effect.runPromise(
  Effect.provide(
    program,
    Notifier.Default
  )
);
```

## Anti-Pattern

Manually creating and passing service instances around. This is the "poor man's DI" and leads to tightly coupled code that is difficult to test and maintain.

```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG: Manual instantiation and prop-drilling.
class LoggerImpl {
  log(msg: string) { console.log(msg); }
}

class NotifierImpl {
  constructor(private logger: LoggerImpl) {}
  notify(msg: string) { this.logger.log(msg); }
}

// Dependencies must be created and passed in manually.
const logger = new LoggerImpl();
const notifier = new NotifierImpl(logger);

// This is not easily testable without creating real instances.
notifier.notify("Hello");
```
