## Guideline

To selectively retry an operation, use `Effect.retry` with a `Schedule` that includes a predicate. The most common way is to use `Schedule.whileInput((error) => ...)`, which will continue retrying only as long as the predicate returns `true` for the error that occurred.

---

## Rationale

Not all errors are created equal. Retrying on a permanent error like "permission denied" or "not found" is pointless and can hide underlying issues. You only want to retry on *transient*, recoverable errors, such as network timeouts or "server busy" responses.

By adding a predicate to your retry schedule, you gain fine-grained control over the retry logic. This allows you to build much more intelligent and efficient error handling systems that react appropriately to different failure modes. This is a common requirement for building robust clients for external APIs.

---

## Good Example

This example simulates an API client that can fail with different, specific error types. The retry policy is configured to *only* retry on `ServerBusyError` and give up immediately on `NotFoundError`.

```typescript
import { Effect, Data, Schedule, Duration } from "effect";

// Define specific, tagged errors for our API client
class ServerBusyError extends Data.TaggedError("ServerBusyError") {}
class NotFoundError extends Data.TaggedError("NotFoundError") {}

let attemptCount = 0;

// A flaky API call that can fail in different ways
const flakyApiCall = Effect.try({
  try: () => {
    attemptCount++;
    const random = Math.random();

    if (attemptCount <= 2) {
      // First two attempts fail with ServerBusyError (retryable)
      console.log(
        `Attempt ${attemptCount}: API call failed - Server is busy. Retrying...`
      );
      throw new ServerBusyError();
    }

    // Third attempt succeeds
    console.log(`Attempt ${attemptCount}: API call succeeded!`);
    return { data: "success", attempt: attemptCount };
  },
  catch: (e) => e as ServerBusyError | NotFoundError,
});

// A predicate that returns true only for the error we want to retry
const isRetryableError = (e: ServerBusyError | NotFoundError) =>
  e._tag === "ServerBusyError";

// A policy that retries 3 times, but only if the error is retryable
const selectiveRetryPolicy = Schedule.recurs(3).pipe(
  Schedule.whileInput(isRetryableError),
  Schedule.addDelay(() => "100 millis")
);

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.logInfo("=== Retry Based on Specific Errors Demo ===");

  try {
    const result = yield* flakyApiCall.pipe(Effect.retry(selectiveRetryPolicy));
    yield* Effect.logInfo(`Success: ${JSON.stringify(result)}`);
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    yield* Effect.logInfo("This won't be reached due to Effect error handling");
    return null;
  }
}).pipe(
  Effect.catchAll((error) =>
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      if (error instanceof NotFoundError) {
        yield* Effect.logInfo("Failed with NotFoundError - not retrying");
      } else if (error instanceof ServerBusyError) {
        yield* Effect.logInfo("Failed with ServerBusyError after all retries");
      } else {
        yield* Effect.logInfo(`Failed with unexpected error: ${error}`);
      }
      return null;
    })
  )
);

// Also demonstrate a case where NotFoundError is not retried
const demonstrateNotFound = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.logInfo("\n=== Demonstrating Non-Retryable Error ===");

  const alwaysNotFound = Effect.fail(new NotFoundError());

  const result = yield* alwaysNotFound.pipe(
    Effect.retry(selectiveRetryPolicy),
    Effect.catchAll((error) =>
      Effect.gen(function* () {
        yield* Effect.logInfo(`NotFoundError was not retried: ${error._tag}`);
        return null;
      })
    )
  );

  return result;
});

Effect.runPromise(program.pipe(Effect.flatMap(() => demonstrateNotFound)));

```

## Anti-Pattern

Using a generic `Effect.retry` that retries on all errors. This can lead to wasted resources and obscure permanent issues.

```typescript
import { Effect, Schedule } from "effect";
import { flakyApiCall } from "./somewhere"; // From previous example

// ‚ùå WRONG: This policy will retry even if the API returns a 404 Not Found.
// This wastes time and network requests on an error that will never succeed.
const blindRetryPolicy = Schedule.recurs(3);

const program = flakyApiCall.pipe(Effect.retry(blindRetryPolicy));
```
