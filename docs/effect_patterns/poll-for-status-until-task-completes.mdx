## Guideline

To run a periodic task (a "poller") that should only run for the duration of another main task, combine them using `Effect.race`. The main task will "win" the race upon completion, which automatically interrupts and cleans up the repeating polling effect.

---

## Rationale

This pattern elegantly solves the problem of coordinating a long-running job with a status-checking mechanism. Instead of manually managing fibers with `fork` and `interrupt`, you can declare this relationship with `Effect.race`.

The key is that the polling effect is set up to repeat on a schedule that runs indefinitely (or for a very long time). Because it never completes on its own, it can never "win" the race. The main task is the only one that can complete successfully. When it does, it wins the race, and Effect's structured concurrency guarantees that the losing effect (the poller) is safely interrupted.

This creates a self-contained, declarative, and leak-free unit of work.

---

## Good Example

This program simulates a long-running data processing job. While it's running, a separate effect polls for its status every 2 seconds. When the main job finishes after 10 seconds, the polling automatically stops.

```typescript
import { Effect, Schedule, Duration } from "effect";

// The main task that takes a long time to complete
const longRunningJob = Effect.log("Data processing complete!").pipe(
  Effect.delay(Duration.seconds(10)),
);

// The polling task that checks the status
const pollStatus = Effect.log("Polling for job status: In Progress...");

// A schedule that repeats the polling task every 2 seconds, forever
const pollingSchedule = Schedule.fixed(Duration.seconds(2));

// The complete polling effect that will run indefinitely until interrupted
const repeatingPoller = pollStatus.pipe(Effect.repeat(pollingSchedule));

// Race the main job against the poller.
// The longRunningJob will win after 10 seconds, interrupting the poller.
const program = Effect.race(longRunningJob, repeatingPoller);

Effect.runPromise(program);
/*
Output:
Polling for job status: In Progress...
Polling for job status: In Progress...
Polling for job status: In Progress...
Polling for job status: In Progress...
Polling for job status: In Progress...
Data processing complete!
*/
```

## Anti-Pattern

Manually managing the lifecycle of the polling fiber. This is more verbose, imperative, and error-prone. You have to remember to interrupt the polling fiber in all possible exit paths (success, failure, etc.), which `Effect.race` does for you automatically.

```typescript
import { Effect, Fiber } from "effect";
import { longRunningJob, repeatingPoller } from "./somewhere";

// ‚ùå WRONG: Manual fiber management is complex.
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  // Manually fork the poller into the background
  const pollerFiber = yield* Effect.fork(repeatingPoller);

  try {
    // Run the main job
    const result = yield* longRunningJob;
    return result;
  } finally {
    // You MUST remember to interrupt the poller when you're done.
    yield* Fiber.interrupt(pollerFiber);
  }
});
```
