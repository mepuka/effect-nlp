### Pattern: `conditionally-branching-workflows.mdx`

## Guideline

To make decisions based on a successful value within an `Effect` pipeline, use predicate-based operators:
-   **To Validate and Fail:** Use `Effect.filter(predicate)` to stop the workflow if a condition is not met.
-   **To Choose a Path:** Use `Effect.if(condition, { onTrue, onFalse })` or `Effect.gen` to execute different effects based on a condition.

---

## Rationale

This pattern allows you to embed decision-making logic directly into your composition pipelines, making your code more declarative and readable. It solves two key problems:

1.  **Separation of Concerns:** It cleanly separates the logic of producing a value from the logic of validating or making decisions about that value.
2.  **Reusable Business Logic:** A predicate function (e.g., `const isAdmin = (user: User) => ...`) becomes a named, reusable, and testable piece of business logic, far superior to scattering inline `if` statements throughout your code.

Using these operators turns conditional logic into a composable part of your `Effect`, rather than an imperative statement that breaks the flow.

## Good Example: Validating a User

Here, we use `Effect.filter` with named predicates to validate a user before proceeding. The intent is crystal clear, and the business rules (`isActive`, `isAdmin`) are reusable.

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

interface User {
  id: number;
  status: "active" | "inactive";
  roles: string[];
}

type UserError = "DbError" | "UserIsInactive" | "UserIsNotAdmin";

const findUser = (id: number): Effect.Effect<User, "DbError"> =>
  Effect.succeed({ id, status: "active", roles: ["admin"] });

// Reusable, testable predicates that document business rules.
const isActive = (user: User): Effect.Effect<boolean> =>
  Effect.succeed(user.status === "active");

const isAdmin = (user: User): Effect.Effect<boolean> =>
  Effect.succeed(user.roles.includes("admin"));

const program = (id: number): Effect.Effect<string, UserError> =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    // Find the user
    const user = yield* findUser(id);

    // Check if user is active
    const active = yield* isActive(user);
    if (!active) {
      return yield* Effect.fail("UserIsInactive" as const);
    }

    // Check if user is admin
    const admin = yield* isAdmin(user);
    if (!admin) {
      return yield* Effect.fail("UserIsNotAdmin" as const);
    }

    // Success case
    return `Welcome, admin user #${user.id}!`;
  });

// We can then handle the specific failures in a type-safe way.
const handled = program(123).pipe(
  Effect.match({
    onFailure: (error) => {
      switch (error) {
        case "UserIsNotAdmin":
          return "Access denied: requires admin role.";
        case "UserIsInactive":
          return "Access denied: user is not active.";
        case "DbError":
          return "Error: could not find user.";
        default:
          return `Unknown error: ${error}`;
      }
    },
    onSuccess: (result) => result
  })
);

// Run the program
Effect.runPromise(handled).then(console.log);
```

---

## Anti-Pattern

Using `Effect.flatMap` with a manual `if` statement and forgetting to handle the `else` case. This is a common mistake that leads to an inferred type of `Effect<void, ...>`, which can cause confusing type errors downstream because the success value is lost.

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";
import { findUser, isAdmin } from "./somewhere"; // From previous example

// ❌ WRONG: The `else` case is missing.
const program = (id: number) =>
  findUser(id).pipe(
    Effect.flatMap((user) => {
      if (isAdmin(user)) {
        // This returns Effect<User>, but what happens if the user is not an admin?
        return Effect.succeed(user);
      }
      // Because there's no `else` branch, TypeScript infers that this
      // block can also implicitly return `void`.
      // The resulting type is Effect<User | void, "DbError">, which is problematic.
    }),
    // This `map` will now have a type error because `u` could be `void`.
    Effect.map((u) => `Welcome, ${u.name}!`),
  );

// `Effect.filter` avoids this problem entirely by forcing a failure,
// which keeps the success channel clean and correctly typed.
```

### Why This is Better

*   **It's a Real Bug:** This isn't just a style issue; it's a legitimate logical error that leads to incorrect types and broken code.
*   **It's a Common Mistake:** Developers new to functional pipelines often forget that every path must return a value.
*   **It Reinforces the "Why":** It perfectly demonstrates *why* `Effect.filter` is superior: `filter` guarantees that if the condition fails, the computation fails, preserving the integrity of the success channel.
