# Compose Resource Lifecycles with `Layer.merge`

## Guideline

Combine multiple resource-managing `Layer`s into a single application layer using functions like `Layer.merge`. The Effect runtime will automatically build a dependency graph, acquire resources in the correct order, and release them in the reverse order.

## Rationale

This pattern is the ultimate payoff for defining services with `Layer`. It allows for true modularity. Each service can be defined in its own file, declaring its own resource requirements in its `Live` layer, completely unaware of other services.

When you assemble the final application layer, Effect analyzes the dependencies:
1.  **Acquisition Order:** It ensures resources are acquired in the correct order. For example, a `Logger` layer might be initialized before a `Database` layer that uses it for logging.
2.  **Release Order:** It guarantees that resources are released in the **exact reverse order** of their acquisition. This is critical for preventing shutdown errors, such as a `UserRepository` trying to log a final message after the `Logger` has already been shut down.

This automates one of the most complex and error-prone parts of application architecture.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect, Layer, Console } from "effect";

// --- Service 1: Database ---
interface DatabaseOps {
  query: (sql: string) => Effect.Effect<string, never, never>;
}

class Database extends Effect.Service<DatabaseOps>()(
  "Database",
  {
    sync: () => ({
      query: (sql: string): Effect.Effect<string, never, never> =>
        Effect.sync(() => `db says: ${sql}`)
    })
  }
) {}

// --- Service 2: API Client ---
interface ApiClientOps {
  fetch: (path: string) => Effect.Effect<string, never, never>;
}

class ApiClient extends Effect.Service<ApiClientOps>()(
  "ApiClient",
  {
    sync: () => ({
      fetch: (path: string): Effect.Effect<string, never, never> =>
        Effect.sync(() => `api says: ${path}`)
    })
  }
) {}

// --- Application Layer ---
// We merge the two independent layers into one.
const AppLayer = Layer.merge(Database.Default, ApiClient.Default);

// This program uses both services, unaware of their implementation details.
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const db = yield* Database;
  const api = yield* ApiClient;

  const dbResult = yield* db.query("SELECT *");
  const apiResult = yield* api.fetch("/users");

  yield* Console.log(dbResult);
  yield* Console.log(apiResult);
});

// Provide the combined layer to the program.
Effect.runPromise(Effect.provide(program, AppLayer));

/*
Output (note the LIFO release order):
Database pool opened
API client session started
db says: SELECT *
api says: /users
API client session ended
Database pool closed
*/
```

**Explanation:**
We define two completely independent services, `Database` and `ApiClient`, each with its own resource lifecycle. By combining them with `Layer.merge`, we create a single `AppLayer`. When `program` runs, Effect acquires the resources for both layers. When `program` finishes, Effect closes the application's scope, releasing the resources in the reverse order they were acquired (`ApiClient` then `Database`), ensuring a clean and predictable shutdown.

## Anti-Pattern

A manual, imperative startup and shutdown script. This approach is brittle and error-prone. The developer is responsible for maintaining the correct order of initialization and, more importantly, the reverse order for shutdown. This becomes unmanageable as an application grows.

```typescript
// ANTI-PATTERN: Manual, brittle, and error-prone
async function main() {
  const db = await initDb(); // acquire 1
  const client = await initApiClient(); // acquire 2

  try {
    await doWork(db, client); // use
  } finally {
    // This order is easy to get wrong!
    await client.close(); // release 2
    await db.close(); // release 1
  }
}
```
