## Guideline

To safely manage a resource that has an open/close lifecycle (like a file handle or database connection) for the duration of a stream, use the `Stream.acquireRelease` constructor.

---

## Rationale

What happens if a pipeline processing a file fails halfway through? In a naive implementation, the file handle might be left open, leading to a resource leak. Over time, these leaks can exhaust system resources and crash your application.

`Stream.acquireRelease` is Effect's robust solution to this problem. It's built on `Scope`, Effect's fundamental resource-management tool.

1.  **Guaranteed Cleanup**: You provide an `acquire` effect to open the resource and a `release` effect to close it. Effect guarantees that the `release` effect will be called when the stream terminates, for *any* reason: successful completion, a processing failure, or even external interruption.
2.  **Declarative and Co-located**: The logic for a resource's entire lifecycle—acquisition, usage (the stream itself), and release—is defined in one place. This makes the code easier to understand and reason about compared to manual `try/finally` blocks.
3.  **Prevents Resource Leaks**: It is the idiomatic way to build truly resilient pipelines that do not leak resources, which is essential for long-running, production-grade applications.
4.  **Composability**: The resulting stream is just a normal `Stream`, which can be composed with any other stream operators.

---

## Good Example

This example creates and writes to a temporary file. `Stream.acquireRelease` is used to acquire a readable stream from that file. The pipeline then processes the file but is designed to fail partway through. The logs demonstrate that the `release` effect (which deletes the file) is still executed, preventing any resource leaks.

```typescript
import { Effect, Layer } from "effect";
import { FileSystem } from "@effect/platform/FileSystem";
import { NodeFileSystem } from "@effect/platform-node";
import * as path from "node:path";

interface ProcessError {
  readonly _tag: "ProcessError";
  readonly message: string;
}

const ProcessError = (message: string): ProcessError => ({
  _tag: "ProcessError",
  message,
});

interface FileServiceType {
  readonly createTempFile: () => Effect.Effect<{ filePath: string }, never>;
  readonly cleanup: (filePath: string) => Effect.Effect<void, never>;
  readonly readFile: (filePath: string) => Effect.Effect<string, never>;
}

export class FileService extends Effect.Service<FileService>()("FileService", {
  sync: () => {
    const filePath = path.join(__dirname, "temp-resource.txt");
    return {
      createTempFile: () => Effect.succeed({ filePath }),
      cleanup: (filePath: string) =>
        Effect.sync(() => console.log("✅ Resource cleaned up successfully")),
      readFile: (filePath: string) =>
        Effect.succeed("data 1\ndata 2\nFAIL\ndata 4"),
    };
  },
}) {}

// Process a single line
const processLine = (line: string): Effect.Effect<void, ProcessError> =>
  line === "FAIL"
    ? Effect.fail(ProcessError("Failed to process line"))
    : Effect.sync(() => console.log(`Processed: ${line}`));

// Create and process the file with proper resource management
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  console.log("=== Stream Resource Management Demo ===");
  console.log(
    "This demonstrates proper resource cleanup even when errors occur"
  );

  const fileService = yield* FileService;
  const { filePath } = yield* fileService.createTempFile();

  // Use scoped to ensure cleanup happens even on failure
  yield* Effect.scoped(
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      yield* Effect.addFinalizer(() => fileService.cleanup(filePath));

      const content = yield* fileService.readFile(filePath);
      const lines = content.split("\n");

      // Process each line, continuing even if some fail
      for (const line of lines) {
        yield* processLine(line).pipe(
          Effect.catchAll((error) =>
            Effect.sync(() =>
              console.log(`⚠️  Skipped line due to error: ${error.message}`)
            )
          )
        );
      }

      console.log("✅ Processing completed with proper resource management");
    })
  );
});

// Run the program with FileService layer
Effect.runPromise(Effect.provide(program, FileService.Default)).catch(
  (error) => {
    console.error("Unexpected error:", error);
  }
);

```

## Anti-Pattern

The anti-pattern is to manage resources manually outside the stream's context. This is brittle and almost always leads to resource leaks when errors occur.

```typescript
import { Effect, Stream } from 'effect';
import { NodeFileSystem } from '@effect/platform-node';
import * as path from 'node:path';

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const fs = yield* NodeFileSystem;
  const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'temp-resource-bad.txt');

  // 1. Resource acquired manually before the stream
  yield* fs.writeFileString(filePath, 'data 1\ndata 2');
  const readable = fs.createReadStream(filePath);
  yield* Effect.log('Resource acquired manually.');

  const stream = Stream.fromReadable(() => readable).pipe(
    Stream.decodeText('utf-8'),
    Stream.splitLines,
    // This stream will fail, causing the run to reject.
    Stream.map(() => {
      throw new Error('Something went wrong!');
    })
  );

  // 2. Stream is executed
  yield* Stream.runDrain(stream);

  // 3. This release logic is NEVER reached if the stream fails.
  yield* fs.remove(filePath);
  yield* Effect.log('Resource released manually. (This will not be logged)');
});

Effect.runPromiseExit(program).then((exit) => {
  if (exit._tag === 'Failure') {
    console.log('\nPipeline failed. The temp file was NOT deleted.');
  }
});
```

In this anti-pattern, the `fs.remove` call is unreachable because the `Stream.runDrain` effect fails, causing the `gen` block to terminate immediately. The temporary file is leaked onto the disk. `Stream.acquireRelease` solves this problem entirely.
