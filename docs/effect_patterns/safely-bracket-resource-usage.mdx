# Safely Bracket Resource Usage with `acquireRelease`

## Guideline

Wrap the acquisition, usage, and release of a resource within an `Effect.acquireRelease` call. This ensures the resource's cleanup logic is executed, regardless of whether the usage logic succeeds, fails, or is interrupted.

## Rationale

This pattern is the foundation of resource safety in Effect. It provides a composable and interruption-safe alternative to a standard `try...finally` block. The `release` effect is guaranteed to execute, preventing resource leaks which are common in complex asynchronous applications, especially those involving concurrency where tasks can be cancelled.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect, Console } from "effect";

// A mock resource that needs to be managed
const getDbConnection = Effect.sync(() => ({ id: Math.random() })).pipe(
  Effect.tap(() => Console.log("Connection Acquired")),
);

const closeDbConnection = (conn: { id: number }): Effect.Effect<void, never, never> =>
  Effect.sync(() => console.log(`Connection ${conn.id} Released`));

// The program that uses the resource
const program = Effect.acquireRelease(
  getDbConnection, // 1. acquire
  (connection) => closeDbConnection(connection) // 2. cleanup
).pipe(
  Effect.tap((connection) =>
    Console.log(`Using connection ${connection.id} to run query...`)
  )
);

Effect.runPromise(Effect.scoped(program));

/*
Output:
Connection Acquired
Using connection 0.12345... to run query...
Connection 0.12345... Released
*/
```

**Explanation:**
By using `Effect.acquireRelease`, the `closeDbConnection` logic is guaranteed to run after the main logic completes. This creates a self-contained, leak-proof unit of work that can be safely composed into larger programs.

## Anti-Pattern

Using a standard `try...finally` block with `async/await`. While it handles success and failure cases, it is **not interruption-safe**. If the fiber executing the `Promise` is interrupted by Effect's structured concurrency, the `finally` block is not guaranteed to run, leading to resource leaks.

```typescript
// ANTI-PATTERN: Not interruption-safe
async function getUser() {
  const connection = await getDbConnectionPromise(); // acquire
  try {
    return await useConnectionPromise(connection); // use
  } finally {
    // This block may not run if the fiber is interrupted!
    await closeConnectionPromise(connection); // release
  }
}
```
