## Guideline

When you need to share mutable state between different concurrent fibers, create a `Ref<A>`. Use `Ref.get` to read the value and `Ref.update` or `Ref.set` to modify it. All operations on a `Ref` are atomic.

---

## Rationale

Directly using a mutable variable (e.g., `let myState = ...`) in a concurrent system is dangerous. Multiple fibers could try to read and write to it at the same time, leading to race conditions and unpredictable results.

`Ref` solves this by wrapping the state in a fiber-safe container. It's like a synchronized, in-memory cell. All operations on a `Ref` are atomic effects, guaranteeing that updates are applied correctly without being interrupted or interleaved with other updates. This eliminates race conditions and ensures data integrity.

---

## Good Example

This program simulates 1,000 concurrent fibers all trying to increment a shared counter. Because we use `Ref.update`, every single increment is applied atomically, and the final result is always correct.

```typescript
import { Effect, Ref } from "effect";

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  // Create a new Ref with an initial value of 0
  const ref = yield* Ref.make(0);

  // Define an effect that increments the counter by 1
  const increment = Ref.update(ref, (n) => n + 1);

  // Create an array of 1,000 increment effects
  const tasks = Array.from({ length: 1000 }, () => increment);

  // Run all 1,000 effects concurrently
  yield* Effect.all(tasks, { concurrency: "unbounded" });

  // Get the final value of the counter
  return yield* Ref.get(ref);
});

// The result will always be 1000
Effect.runPromise(program).then(console.log);

```

---

## Anti-Pattern

The anti-pattern is using a standard JavaScript variable for shared state. The following example is not guaranteed to produce the correct result.

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

// ❌ WRONG: This is a classic race condition.
const programWithRaceCondition = Effect.gen(function* () {
  let count = 0; // A plain, mutable variable

  // An effect that reads, increments, and writes the variable
  const increment = Effect.sync(() => {
    const current = count;
    // Another fiber could run between this read and the write below!
    count = current + 1;
  });

  const tasks = Array.from({ length: 1000 }, () => increment);

  yield* Effect.all(tasks, { concurrency: "unbounded" });

  return count;
});

// The result is unpredictable and will likely be less than 1000.
Effect.runPromise(programWithRaceCondition).then(console.log);
```
