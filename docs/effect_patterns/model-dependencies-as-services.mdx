# Model Dependencies as Services

## Guideline

Represent any external dependency or distinct capability—from a database client to a simple UUID generator—as a service.

## Rationale

This pattern is the key to testability. It allows you to provide a `Live` implementation in production and a `Test` implementation (returning mock data) in your tests, making your code decoupled and reliable.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

// Define Random service with production implementation as default
export class Random extends Effect.Service<Random>()(
  "Random",
  {
    // Default production implementation
    sync: () => ({
      next: Effect.sync(() => Math.random())
    })
  }
) {}

// Example usage
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const random = yield* Random;
  const value = yield* random.next;
  return value;
});

// Run with default implementation
Effect.runPromise(
  Effect.provide(
    program,
    Random.Default
  )
).then(value => console.log('Random value:', value));
```

**Explanation:**  
By modeling dependencies as services, you can easily substitute mocked or deterministic implementations for testing, leading to more reliable and predictable tests.

## Anti-Pattern

Directly calling external APIs like `fetch` or using impure functions like `Math.random()` within your business logic. This tightly couples your logic to a specific implementation and makes it difficult to test.
