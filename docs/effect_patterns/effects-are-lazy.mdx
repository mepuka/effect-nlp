# Understand that Effects are Lazy Blueprints

## Guideline

An `Effect` is not a value or a `Promise`. It is a lazy, immutable blueprint
that describes a computation. It does nothing on its own until it is passed to
a runtime executor (e.g., `Effect.runPromise` or `Effect.runSync`).

## Rationale

This laziness is a superpower because it makes your code composable,
predictable, and testable. Unlike a `Promise` which executes immediately,
an `Effect` is just a description of work, like a recipe waiting for a chef.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

console.log("1. Defining the Effect blueprint...");

const program = Effect.sync(() => {
  console.log("3. The blueprint is now being executed!");
  return 42;
});

console.log("2. The blueprint has been defined. No work has been done yet.");

Effect.runSync(program);
```

**Explanation:**  
Defining an `Effect` does not execute any code inside it. Only when you call
`Effect.runSync(program)` does the computation actually happen.

## Anti-Pattern

Assuming an `Effect` behaves like a `Promise`. A `Promise` executes its work
immediately upon creation. Never expect a side effect to occur just from
defining an `Effect`.
