## Guideline

To handle specific points in time robustly in Effect, follow these principles:
1.  **Access "now" via the `Clock` service** (`Clock.currentTimeMillis`) instead of `Date.now()`.
2.  **Store and pass timestamps** as immutable primitives: `number` for UTC milliseconds or `string` for ISO 8601 format.
3.  **Perform calculations locally:** When you need to perform date-specific calculations (e.g., "get the day of the week"), create a `new Date(timestamp)` instance inside a pure computation, use it, and then discard it. Never hold onto mutable `Date` objects in your application state.

---

## Rationale

JavaScript's native `Date` object is a common source of bugs. It is mutable, its behavior can be inconsistent across different JavaScript environments (especially with timezones), and its reliance on the system clock makes time-dependent logic difficult to test.

Effect's approach solves these problems:
-   The **`Clock` service** abstracts away the concept of "now." In production, the `Live` clock uses the system time. In tests, you can provide a `TestClock` that gives you complete, deterministic control over the passage of time.
-   Using **primitive `number` or `string`** for timestamps ensures immutability and makes your data easy to serialize, store, and transfer.

This makes your time-based logic pure, predictable, and easy to test.

---

## Good Example

This example shows a function that creates a timestamped event. It depends on the `Clock` service, making it fully testable.

```typescript
import { Effect, Clock } from "effect";
import type * as Types from "effect/Clock";

interface Event {
  readonly message: string;
  readonly timestamp: number; // Store as a primitive number (UTC millis)
}

// This function is pure and testable because it depends on Clock
const createEvent = (message: string): Effect.Effect<Event, never, Types.Clock> =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const timestamp = yield* Clock.currentTimeMillis;
    return { message, timestamp };
  });

// Create and log some events
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const loginEvent = yield* createEvent("User logged in");
  console.log("Login event:", loginEvent);

  const logoutEvent = yield* createEvent("User logged out");
  console.log("Logout event:", logoutEvent);
});

// Run the program
Effect.runPromise(program.pipe(Effect.provideService(Clock.Clock, Clock.make()))).catch(console.error);
```

---

## Anti-Pattern

Directly using `Date.now()` or `new Date()` inside your effects. This introduces impurity and makes your logic dependent on the actual system clock, rendering it non-deterministic and difficult to test.

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

// ‚ùå WRONG: This function is impure and not reliably testable.
const createEventUnsafely = (message: string): Effect.Effect<any> =>
  Effect.sync(() => ({
    message,
    timestamp: Date.now(), // Direct call to a system API
  }));

// How would you test that this function assigns the correct timestamp
// without manipulating the system clock or using complex mocks?
```
