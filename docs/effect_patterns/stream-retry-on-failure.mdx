## Guideline

To make a data pipeline resilient to transient failures, apply the `.retry(Schedule)` operator to the `Stream`.

---

## Rationale

Real-world systems are unreliable. Network connections drop, APIs return temporary `503` errors, and databases can experience deadlocks. A naive pipeline will fail completely on the first sign of trouble. A resilient pipeline, however, can absorb these transient errors and heal itself.

The `retry` operator, combined with the `Schedule` module, provides a powerful and declarative way to build this resilience:

1.  **Declarative Resilience**: Instead of writing complex `try/catch` loops with manual delay logic, you declaratively state *how* the pipeline should retry. For example, "retry 3 times, with an exponential backoff starting at 100ms."
2.  **Separation of Concerns**: Your core pipeline logic remains focused on the "happy path." The retry strategy is a separate, composable concern that you apply to the entire stream.
3.  **Rich Scheduling Policies**: `Schedule` is incredibly powerful. You can create schedules based on a fixed number of retries, exponential backoff, jitter (to avoid thundering herd problems), or even combinations of these.
4.  **Prevents Cascading Failures**: By handling temporary issues at the source, you prevent a small, transient glitch from causing a complete failure of your entire application.

---

## Good Example

This example simulates an API that fails the first two times it's called. The stream processes a list of IDs, and the `retry` operator ensures that the failing operation for `id: 2` is automatically retried until it succeeds.

````typescript
import { Effect, Stream, Schedule } from "effect";

// A mock function that simulates a flaky API call
const processItem = (id: number): Effect.Effect<string, Error> =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    yield* Effect.log(`Attempting to process item ${id}...`);

    // Item 2 fails on first attempt but succeeds on retry
    if (id === 2) {
      const random = Math.random();
      if (random < 0.5) {
        // 50% chance of failure for demonstration
        yield* Effect.log(`Item ${id} failed, will retry...`);
        return yield* Effect.fail(new Error("API is temporarily down"));
      }
    }

    yield* Effect.log(`✅ Successfully processed item ${id}`);
    return `Processed item ${id}`;
  });

const ids = [1, 2, 3];

// Define a retry policy: 3 attempts with a fixed 100ms delay
const retryPolicy = Schedule.recurs(3).pipe(
  Schedule.addDelay(() => "100 millis")
);

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.log("=== Stream Retry on Failure Demo ===");
  yield* Effect.log(
    "Processing items with retry policy (3 attempts, 100ms delay)"
  );

  // Process each item individually with retry
  const results = yield* Effect.forEach(
    ids,
    (id) =>
      processItem(id).pipe(
        Effect.retry(retryPolicy),
        Effect.catchAll((error) =>
          Effect.gen(function* () {
            yield* Effect.log(
              `❌ Item ${id} failed after all retries: ${error.message}`
            );
            return `Failed: item ${id}`;
          })
        )
      ),
    { concurrency: 1 }
  );

  yield* Effect.log("=== Results ===");
  results.forEach((result, index) => {
    console.log(`Item ${ids[index]}: ${result}`);
  });

  yield* Effect.log("✅ Stream processing completed");
});

Effect.runPromise(program).catch((error) => {
  console.error("Unexpected error:", error);
});
/*
Output:
... level=INFO msg="Attempting to process item 1..."
... level=INFO msg="Attempting to process item 2..."
... level=INFO msg="Item 2 failed, attempt 1."
... level=INFO msg="Attempting to process item 2..."
... level=INFO msg="Item 2 failed, attempt 2."
... level=INFO msg="Attempting to process item 2..."
... level=INFO msg="Attempting to process item 3..."
*/

````

## Anti-Pattern

The anti-pattern is to either have no retry logic at all, or to write manual, imperative retry loops inside your processing function.

````typescript
import { Effect, Stream } from 'effect';
// ... same mock processItem function ...

const ids = [1, 2, 3];

const program = Stream.fromIterable(ids).pipe(
  // No retry logic. The entire stream will fail when item 2 fails.
  Stream.mapEffect(processItem, { concurrency: 1 }),
  Stream.runDrain
);

Effect.runPromise(program).catch((error) => {
  console.error('Pipeline failed:', error);
});
/*
Output:
... level=INFO msg="Attempting to process item 1..."
... level=INFO msg="Attempting to process item 2..."
... level=INFO msg="Item 2 failed, attempt 1."
Pipeline failed: Error: API is temporarily down
*/
````

This "fail-fast" approach is brittle. A single, temporary network blip would cause the entire pipeline to terminate, even if subsequent items could have been processed successfully. While manual retry logic inside `processItem` is possible, it pollutes the core logic with concerns about timing and attempt counting, and is far less composable and reusable than a `Schedule`.
