## Guideline

To enable graceful shutdown for a long-running application:
1.  Define services with cleanup logic in `scoped` `Layer`s using `Effect.addFinalizer` or `Effect.acquireRelease`.
2.  Launch your main application `Effect` using `Effect.runFork` to get a `Fiber` handle to the running process.
3.  Set up listeners for process signals like `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) and `SIGTERM`.
4.  In the signal handler, call `Fiber.interrupt` on your application's fiber.

---

## Rationale

When a server process is terminated, you need to ensure that it cleans up properly. This includes closing database connections, finishing in-flight requests, and releasing file handles. Failing to do so can lead to resource leaks or data corruption.

Effect's structured concurrency makes this robust and easy. When a fiber is interrupted, Effect guarantees that it will run all finalizers registered within that fiber's scope, in the reverse order they were acquired.

By launching your app with `runFork`, you get a `Fiber` that represents the entire application. Triggering `Fiber.interrupt` on this top-level fiber initiates a clean, orderly shutdown sequence for all its resources.

---

## Good Example

This example creates a server with a "scoped" database connection. It uses `runFork` to start the server and sets up a `SIGINT` handler to interrupt the server fiber, which in turn guarantees the database finalizer is called.

```typescript
import { Effect, Layer, Fiber, Context, Scope } from "effect";
import * as http from "http";

// 1. A service with a finalizer for cleanup
class Database extends Effect.Service<Database>()("Database", {
  effect: Effect.gen(function* () {
    yield* Effect.log("Acquiring DB connection");
    return {
      query: () => Effect.succeed("data"),
    };
  }),
}) {}

// 2. The main server logic
const server = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const db = yield* Database;

  // Create server with proper error handling
  const httpServer = yield* Effect.sync(() => {
    const server = http.createServer((_req, res) => {
      Effect.runFork(
        Effect.provide(
          db.query().pipe(Effect.map((data) => res.end(data))),
          Database.Default
        )
      );
    });
    return server;
  });

  // Add a finalizer to close the server
  yield* Effect.addFinalizer(() =>
    Effect.sync(() => {
      httpServer.close();
      console.log("Server closed");
    })
  );

  // Start server with error handling
  yield* Effect.async<void, Error>((resume) => {
    httpServer.once('error', (err: Error) => {
      resume(Effect.fail(new Error(`Failed to start server: ${err.message}`)));
    });

    httpServer.listen(3456, () => {
      resume(Effect.succeed(void 0));
    });
  });

  yield* Effect.log("Server started on port 3456. Press Ctrl+C to exit.");

  // For testing purposes, we'll run for a short time instead of forever
  yield* Effect.sleep("2 seconds");
  yield* Effect.log("Shutting down gracefully...");
});

// 3. Provide the layer and launch with runFork
const app = Effect.provide(server.pipe(Effect.scoped), Database.Default);

// 4. Run the app and handle shutdown
Effect.runPromise(app).catch((error) => {
  console.error("Application error:", error);
  process.exit(1);
});

```

## Anti-Pattern

Letting the Node.js process exit without proper cleanup. If you run a long-running effect with `Effect.runPromise` or don't handle OS signals, pressing Ctrl+C will terminate the process abruptly, and none of your `Effect` finalizers will have a chance to run.

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";
import { app } from "./somewhere"; // From previous example

// ‚ùå WRONG: This will run the server, but Ctrl+C will kill it instantly.
// The database connection finalizer will NOT be called.
Effect.runPromise(app);
```
