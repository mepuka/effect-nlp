# Control Flow with Conditional Combinators

## Guideline

Use declarative combinators like `Effect.if`, `Effect.when`, and
`Effect.unless` to execute effects based on runtime conditions.

## Rationale

These combinators allow you to embed conditional logic directly into your
`.pipe()` compositions, maintaining a declarative style for simple branching.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect"

const attemptAdminAction = (user: { isAdmin: boolean }) =>
  Effect.if(user.isAdmin, {
    onTrue: () => Effect.succeed("Admin action completed."),
    onFalse: () => Effect.fail("Permission denied.")
  })

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  // Try with admin user
  yield* Effect.logInfo("\nTrying with admin user...")
  const adminResult = yield* Effect.either(attemptAdminAction({ isAdmin: true }))
  yield* Effect.logInfo(`Admin result: ${adminResult._tag === 'Right' ? adminResult.right : adminResult.left}`)

  // Try with non-admin user
  yield* Effect.logInfo("\nTrying with non-admin user...")
  const userResult = yield* Effect.either(attemptAdminAction({ isAdmin: false }))
  yield* Effect.logInfo(`User result: ${userResult._tag === 'Right' ? userResult.right : userResult.left}`)
})

Effect.runPromise(program)
```

**Explanation:**  
`Effect.if` and related combinators allow you to branch logic without leaving
the Effect world or breaking the flow of composition.

## Anti-Pattern

Using `Effect.gen` for a single, simple conditional check can be more verbose
than necessary. For simple branching, `Effect.if` is often more concise.
