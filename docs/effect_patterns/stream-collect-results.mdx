## Guideline

To execute a stream and collect all of its emitted values into a single, in-memory list, use the `Stream.runCollect` sink.

---

## Rationale

A "sink" is a terminal operator that consumes a stream and produces a final `Effect`. `Stream.runCollect` is the most fundamental sink. It provides the bridge from the lazy, pull-based world of `Stream` back to the familiar world of a single `Effect` that resolves with a standard data structure.

Using `Stream.runCollect` is essential when:

1.  **You Need the Final Result**: The goal of your pipeline is to produce a complete list of transformed items that you need to use in a subsequent step (e.g., to return as a single JSON array from an API).
2.  **Simplicity is Key**: It's the most straightforward way to "run" a stream and see its output. It declaratively states your intent: "execute this entire pipeline and give me all the results."
3.  **The Dataset is Bounded**: It's designed for streams where the total number of items is known to be finite and small enough to fit comfortably in memory.

The result of `Stream.runCollect` is an `Effect` that, when executed, yields a `Chunk` containing all the items emitted by the stream.

---

## Good Example

This example creates a stream of numbers, filters for only the even ones, transforms them into strings, and then uses `runCollect` to gather the final results into a `Chunk`.

```typescript
import { Effect, Stream, Chunk } from 'effect';

const program = Stream.range(1, 10).pipe(
  // Find all the even numbers
  Stream.filter((n) => n % 2 === 0),
  // Transform them into strings
  Stream.map((n) => `Even number: ${n}`),
  // Run the stream and collect the results
  Stream.runCollect
);

Effect.runPromise(program).then((results) => {
  console.log('Collected results:', Chunk.toArray(results));
});
/*
Output:
Collected results: [
  'Even number: 2',
  'Even number: 4',
  'Even number: 6',
  'Even number: 8',
  'Even number: 10'
]
*/
```

## Anti-Pattern

The anti-pattern is using `Stream.runCollect` on a stream that produces an unbounded or extremely large number of items. This will inevitably lead to an out-of-memory error.

```typescript
import { Effect, Stream } from 'effect';

// An infinite stream of numbers
const infiniteStream = Stream.range(1, Infinity);

const program = infiniteStream.pipe(
  // This will run forever, attempting to buffer an infinite number of items.
  Stream.runCollect
);

// This program will never finish and will eventually crash the process
// by consuming all available memory.
// Effect.runPromise(program);
console.log(
  'This code is commented out because it would cause an out-of-memory crash.'
);
```

This is a critical mistake because `runCollect` must hold every single item emitted by the stream in memory simultaneously. For pipelines that process huge files, infinite data sources, or are designed to run forever, `runCollect` is the wrong tool. In those cases, you should use a sink like `Stream.runDrain`, which processes items without collecting them.
