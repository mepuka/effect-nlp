# Manually Manage Lifecycles with `Scope`

## Guideline

For complex scenarios where a resource's lifecycle doesn't fit a simple `acquireRelease` pattern, use `Effect.scope` to create a boundary for finalizers. Inside this boundary, you can access the `Scope` service and manually register cleanup actions using `Scope.addFinalizer`.

## Rationale

While `Effect.acquireRelease` and `Layer.scoped` are sufficient for most use cases, sometimes you need more control. This pattern is essential when:
1.  A single logical operation acquires multiple resources that need independent cleanup.
2.  You are building a custom, complex `Layer` that orchestrates several dependent resources.
3.  You need to understand the fundamental mechanism that powers all of Effect's resource management.

By interacting with `Scope` directly, you gain precise, imperative-style control over resource cleanup within Effect's declarative, functional framework. Finalizers added to a scope are guaranteed to run in Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order when the scope is closed.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect, Console } from "effect";

// Mocking a complex file operation
const openFile = (path: string) =>
  Effect.succeed({ path, handle: Math.random() }).pipe(
    Effect.tap((f) => Console.log(`Opened ${f.path}`)),
  );
const createTempFile = (path: string) =>
  Effect.succeed({ path: `${path}.tmp`, handle: Math.random() }).pipe(
    Effect.tap((f) => Console.log(`Created temp file ${f.path}`)),
  );
const closeFile = (file: { path: string }) =>
  Effect.sync(() => Console.log(`Closed ${file.path}`));
const deleteFile = (file: { path: string }) =>
  Effect.sync(() => Console.log(`Deleted ${file.path}`));

// This program acquires two resources (a file and a temp file)
// and ensures both are cleaned up correctly using acquireRelease.
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const file = yield* Effect.acquireRelease(
    openFile("data.csv"),
    (f) => closeFile(f)
  );

  const tempFile = yield* Effect.acquireRelease(
    createTempFile("data.csv"),
    (f) => deleteFile(f)
  );

  yield* Console.log("...writing data from temp file to main file...");
});

// Run the program with a scope
Effect.runPromise(Effect.scoped(program));

/*
Output (note the LIFO cleanup order):
Opened data.csv
Created temp file data.csv.tmp
...writing data from temp file to main file...
Deleted data.csv.tmp
Closed data.csv
*/
```

**Explanation:**
`Effect.scope` creates a new `Scope` and provides it to the `program`. Inside `program`, we access this `Scope` and use `addFinalizer` to register cleanup actions immediately after acquiring each resource. When `Effect.scope` finishes executing `program`, it closes the scope, which in turn executes all registered finalizers in the reverse order of their addition.

## Anti-Pattern

Attempting to manage multiple, interdependent resource cleanups using nested `try...finally` blocks. This leads to a "pyramid of doom," is difficult to read, and remains unsafe in the face of interruptions.

```typescript
// ANTI-PATTERN: Nested, unsafe, and hard to read
async function complexOperation() {
  const file = await openFilePromise(); // acquire 1
  try {
    const tempFile = await createTempFilePromise(); // acquire 2
    try {
      await doWorkPromise(file, tempFile); // use
    } finally {
      // This block may not run on interruption!
      await deleteFilePromise(tempFile); // release 2
    }
  } finally {
    // This block may also not run on interruption!
    await closeFilePromise(file); // release 1
  }
}
```
