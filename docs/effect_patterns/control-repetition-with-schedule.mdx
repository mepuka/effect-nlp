## Guideline

A `Schedule<In, Out>` is a highly-composable blueprint that defines a recurring schedule. It takes an input of type `In` (e.g., the error from a failed effect) and produces an output of type `Out` (e.g., the decision to continue). Use `Schedule` with operators like `Effect.repeat` and `Effect.retry` to control complex repeating logic.

---

## Rationale

While you could write manual loops or recursive functions, `Schedule` provides a much more powerful, declarative, and composable way to manage repetition. The key benefits are:

-   **Declarative:** You separate the *what* (the effect to run) from the *how* and *when* (the schedule it runs on).
-   **Composable:** You can build complex schedules from simple, primitive ones. For example, you can create a schedule that runs "up to 5 times, with an exponential backoff, plus some random jitter" by composing `Schedule.recurs`, `Schedule.exponential`, and `Schedule.jittered`.
-   **Stateful:** A `Schedule` keeps track of its own state (like the number of repetitions), making it easy to create policies that depend on the execution history.

---

## Good Example

This example demonstrates composition by creating a common, robust retry policy: exponential backoff with jitter, limited to 5 attempts.

```typescript
import { Effect, Schedule, Duration } from "effect"

// A simple effect that can fail
const flakyEffect = Effect.try({
  try: () => {
    if (Math.random() > 0.2) {
      throw new Error("Transient error")
    }
    return "Operation succeeded!"
  },
  catch: (error: unknown) => {
    Effect.logInfo("Operation failed, retrying...")
    return error
  }
})

// --- Building a Composable Schedule ---

// 1. Start with a base exponential backoff (100ms, 200ms, 400ms...)
const exponentialBackoff = Schedule.exponential("100 millis")

// 2. Add random jitter to avoid thundering herd problems
const withJitter = Schedule.jittered(exponentialBackoff)

// 3. Limit the schedule to a maximum of 5 repetitions
const limitedWithJitter = Schedule.compose(
  withJitter,
  Schedule.recurs(5)
)

// --- Using the Schedule ---
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.logInfo("Starting operation...")
  const result = yield* Effect.retry(flakyEffect, limitedWithJitter)
  yield* Effect.logInfo(`Final result: ${result}`)
})

// Run the program
Effect.runPromise(program)
```

## Anti-Pattern

Writing manual, imperative retry logic. This is verbose, stateful, hard to reason about, and not easily composable.

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";
import { flakyEffect } from "./somewhere";

// ‚ùå WRONG: Manual, stateful, and complex retry logic.
function manualRetry(
  effect: typeof flakyEffect,
  retriesLeft: number,
  delay: number,
): Effect.Effect<string, "ApiError"> {
  return effect.pipe(
    Effect.catchTag("ApiError", () => {
      if (retriesLeft > 0) {
        return Effect.sleep(delay).pipe(
          Effect.flatMap(() => manualRetry(effect, retriesLeft - 1, delay * 2)),
        );
      }
      return Effect.fail("ApiError" as const);
    }),
  );
}

const program = manualRetry(flakyEffect, 5, 100);
```
