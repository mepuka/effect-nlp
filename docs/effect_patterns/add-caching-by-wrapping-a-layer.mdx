## Guideline

To add cross-cutting concerns like caching to a service, create a "wrapper" `Layer`. This is a layer that takes the original service's `Layer` as input (as a dependency) and returns a new `Layer`. The new layer provides the same service interface but wraps the original methods with additional logic (e.g., checking a cache before calling the original method).

---

## Rationale

You often want to add functionality like caching, logging, or metrics to a service without polluting its core business logic. The wrapper layer pattern is a clean way to achieve this.

By creating a layer that *requires* the original service, you can get an instance of it from the context, and then provide a *new* implementation of that same service that calls the original.

This approach is powerful because:
-   **It's Non-Invasive:** The original service (`DatabaseLive`) remains completely unchanged.
-   **It's Composable:** You can apply multiple wrappers. You could wrap a database layer with a caching layer, then wrap that with a metrics layer.
-   **It's Explicit:** The composition is clearly defined at the application's top level where you build your final `AppLayer`.

## Good Example

We have a `WeatherService` that makes slow API calls. We create a `WeatherService.cached` wrapper layer that adds an in-memory cache using a `Ref` and a `Map`.

```typescript
import { Effect, Layer, Ref } from "effect";

// 1. Define the service interface
class WeatherService extends Effect.Service<WeatherService>()(
  "WeatherService",
  {
    sync: () => ({
      getForecast: (city: string) => Effect.succeed(`Sunny in ${city}`),
    }),
  }
) {}

// 2. The "Live" implementation that is slow
const WeatherServiceLive = Layer.succeed(
  WeatherService,
  WeatherService.of({
    _tag: "WeatherService",
    getForecast: (city) =>
      Effect.succeed(`Sunny in ${city}`).pipe(
        Effect.delay("2 seconds"),
        Effect.tap(() => Effect.log(`Fetched live forecast for ${city}`))
      ),
  })
);

// 3. The Caching Wrapper Layer
const WeatherServiceCached = Layer.effect(
  WeatherService,
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    // It REQUIRES the original WeatherService
    const underlyingService = yield* WeatherService;
    const cache = yield* Ref.make(new Map<string, string>());

    return WeatherService.of({
      _tag: "WeatherService",
      getForecast: (city) =>
        Ref.get(cache).pipe(
          Effect.flatMap((map) =>
            map.has(city)
              ? Effect.log(`Cache HIT for ${city}`).pipe(
                  Effect.as(map.get(city)!)
                )
              : Effect.log(`Cache MISS for ${city}`).pipe(
                  Effect.flatMap(() => underlyingService.getForecast(city)),
                  Effect.tap((forecast) =>
                    Ref.update(cache, (map) => map.set(city, forecast))
                  )
                )
          )
        ),
    });
  })
);

// 4. Compose the final layer. The wrapper is provided with the live implementation.
const AppLayer = Layer.provide(WeatherServiceCached, WeatherServiceLive);

// 5. The application logic
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const weather = yield* WeatherService;
  yield* weather.getForecast("London"); // First call is slow (MISS)
  yield* weather.getForecast("London"); // Second call is instant (HIT)
});

Effect.runPromise(Effect.provide(program, AppLayer));

```

## Anti-Pattern

Modifying the original service implementation to include caching logic directly. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle by mixing the core logic of fetching weather with the cross-cutting concern of caching.

```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG: The service is now responsible for both its logic and its caching strategy.
const WeatherServiceWithInlineCache = Layer.effect(
  WeatherService,
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const cache = yield* Ref.make(new Map<string, string>());
    return WeatherService.of({
      getForecast: (city) => {
        // ...caching logic mixed directly with fetching logic...
        return Effect.succeed("...");
      },
    });
  }),
);
```
