# Provide Configuration to Your App via a Layer

## Guideline

Transform your configuration schema into a `Layer` using `Config.layer()` and provide it to your main application `Effect`.

## Rationale

Integrating configuration as a `Layer` plugs it directly into Effect's dependency injection system. This makes your configuration available anywhere in the program and dramatically simplifies testing by allowing you to substitute mock configuration.

## Good Example

````typescript
import { Effect, Layer } from "effect";

class ServerConfig extends Effect.Service<ServerConfig>()(
  "ServerConfig",
  {
    sync: () => ({
      port: process.env.PORT ? parseInt(process.env.PORT) : 8080
    })
  }
) {}

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const config = yield* ServerConfig;
  yield* Effect.log(`Starting application on port ${config.port}...`);
});

Effect.runPromise(
  Effect.provide(program, ServerConfig.Default)
).catch(console.error);
````

**Explanation:**  
This approach makes configuration available contextually, supporting better testing and modularity.

## Anti-Pattern

Manually reading environment variables deep inside business logic. This tightly couples that logic to the external environment, making it difficult to test and reuse.
