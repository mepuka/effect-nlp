## Guideline

To compare objects or classes by their contents rather than by their memory reference, use one of two methods:
1.  **For plain data objects:** Define them with `Data.struct`.
2.  **For classes:** Extend `Data.Class` or implement the `Equal.Equal` interface.

Then, compare instances using the `Equal.equals(a, b)` function.

---

## Rationale

In JavaScript, comparing two non-primitive values with `===` checks for *referential equality*. It only returns `true` if they are the exact same instance in memory. This means two objects with identical contents are not considered equal, which is a common source of bugs.

```typescript
{ a: 1 } === { a: 1 } // false!
```

Effect solves this with **structural equality**. All of Effect's built-in data structures (`Option`, `Either`, `Chunk`, etc.) can be compared by their structure and values. By using helpers like `Data.struct`, you can easily give your own data structures this same powerful and predictable behavior.

---

## Good Example

We define two points using `Data.struct`. Even though `p1` and `p2` are different instances in memory, `Equal.equals` correctly reports them as equal because their contents match.

```typescript
import { Data, Equal, Effect } from "effect";

// Define a Point type with structural equality
interface Point {
  readonly _tag: "Point";
  readonly x: number;
  readonly y: number;
}

const Point = Data.tagged<Point>("Point");

// Create a program to demonstrate structural equality
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const p1 = Point({ x: 1, y: 2 });
  const p2 = Point({ x: 1, y: 2 });
  const p3 = Point({ x: 3, y: 4 });

  // Standard reference equality fails
  yield* Effect.log("Comparing points with reference equality (===):");
  yield* Effect.log(`p1 === p2: ${p1 === p2}`);

  // Structural equality works as expected
  yield* Effect.log("\nComparing points with structural equality:");
  yield* Effect.log(`p1 equals p2: ${Equal.equals(p1, p2)}`);
  yield* Effect.log(`p1 equals p3: ${Equal.equals(p1, p3)}`);

  // Show the actual points
  yield* Effect.log("\nPoint values:");
  yield* Effect.log(`p1: ${JSON.stringify(p1)}`);
  yield* Effect.log(`p2: ${JSON.stringify(p2)}`);
  yield* Effect.log(`p3: ${JSON.stringify(p3)}`);
});

// Run the program
Effect.runPromise(program);
```

## Anti-Pattern

Relying on `===` for object or array comparison. This will lead to bugs when you expect two objects with the same values to be treated as equal, especially when working with data in collections, `Ref`s, or `Effect`'s success values.

```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG: This will not behave as expected.
const user1 = { id: 1, name: "Paul" };
const user2 = { id: 1, name: "Paul" };

if (user1 === user2) {
  // This code block will never be reached.
  console.log("Users are the same.");
}

// Another common pitfall
const selectedUsers = [user1];
// This check will fail, even though a user with id 1 is in the array.
if (selectedUsers.includes({ id: 1, name: "Paul" })) {
  // ...
}
```
