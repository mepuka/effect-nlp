## Guideline

To significantly improve your development experience with Effect, install the official **Effect Language Server (LSP)** extension for your code editor (e.g., the "Effect" extension in VS Code).

---

## Rationale

Effect's type system is incredibly powerful, but TypeScript's default language server doesn't always display the rich information contained within the `A`, `E`, and `R` channels in the most intuitive way.

The Effect LSP is a specialized tool that understands the semantics of Effect. It hooks into your editor to provide a superior experience:
-   **Rich Inline Types:** It displays the full `Effect<A, E, R>` signature directly in your code as you work, so you always know exactly what an effect produces, how it can fail, and what it requires.
-   **Clear Error Messages:** It provides more specific and helpful error messages tailored to Effect's APIs.
-   **Enhanced Autocompletion:** It can offer more context-aware suggestions.

This tool essentially makes the compiler's knowledge visible at a glance, reducing the mental overhead of tracking complex types and allowing you to catch errors before you even save the file.

---

## Good Example

Imagine you have the following code. Without the LSP, hovering over `program` might show a complex, hard-to-read inferred type.

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

// Define Logger service using Effect.Service pattern
class Logger extends Effect.Service<Logger>()(
  "Logger",
  {
    sync: () => ({
      log: (msg: string) => Effect.sync(() => console.log(`LOG: ${msg}`))
    })
  }
) {}

const program = Effect.succeed(42).pipe(
  Effect.map((n) => n.toString()),
  Effect.flatMap((s) => Effect.log(s)),
  Effect.provide(Logger.Default)
);

// Run the program
Effect.runPromise(program);
```

With the Effect LSP installed, your editor would display a clear, readable overlay right above the `program` variable, looking something like this:

```
// (LSP Inlay Hint)
// program: Effect<void, never, never>
```

This immediately tells you that the final program returns nothing (`void`), has no expected failures (`never`), and has no remaining requirements (`never`), so it's ready to be run.

## Anti-Pattern

Going without the LSP. While your code will still compile and work perfectly fine, you are essentially "flying blind." You miss out on the rich, real-time feedback that the LSP provides, forcing you to rely more heavily on manual type checking, `tsc` runs, and deciphering complex inferred types from your editor's default tooltips. This leads to a slower, less efficient development cycle.
