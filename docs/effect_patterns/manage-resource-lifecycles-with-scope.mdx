## Guideline

A `Scope` is a context that collects finalizers (cleanup effects). When you need fine-grained control over resource lifecycles, you can work with `Scope` directly. The most common pattern is to create a resource within a scope using `Effect.acquireRelease` and then use it via `Effect.scoped`.

---

## Rationale

`Scope` is the fundamental building block for all resource management in Effect. While higher-level APIs like `Layer.scoped` and `Stream` are often sufficient, understanding `Scope` is key to advanced use cases.

A `Scope` guarantees that any finalizers added to it will be executed when the scope is closed, regardless of whether the associated computation succeeds, fails, or is interrupted. This provides a rock-solid guarantee against resource leaks.

This is especially critical in concurrent applications. When a parent fiber is interrupted, it closes its scope, which in turn automatically interrupts all its child fibers and runs all their finalizers in a structured, predictable order.

---

## Good Example

This example shows how to acquire a resource (like a file handle), use it, and have `Scope` guarantee its release.

```typescript
import { Effect, Scope } from "effect";

// Simulate acquiring and releasing a resource
const acquireFile = Effect.log("File opened").pipe(
  Effect.as({ write: (data: string) => Effect.log(`Wrote: ${data}`) }),
);
const releaseFile = Effect.log("File closed.");

// Create a "scoped" effect. This effect, when used, will acquire the
// resource and register its release action with the current scope.
const scopedFile = Effect.acquireRelease(acquireFile, () => releaseFile);

// The main program that uses the scoped resource
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  // Effect.scoped "uses" the resource. It runs the acquire effect,
  // provides the resource to the inner effect, and ensures the
  // release effect is run when this block completes.
  const file = yield* Effect.scoped(scopedFile);

  yield* file.write("hello");
  yield* file.write("world");

  // The file will be automatically closed here.
});

Effect.runPromise(program);
/*
Output:
File opened
Wrote: hello
Wrote: world
File closed
*/
```

---

## Anti-Pattern

Manual resource management without the guarantees of `Scope`. This is brittle because if an error occurs after the resource is acquired but before it's released, the release logic is never executed.

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";
import { acquireFile, releaseFile } from "./somewhere"; // From previous example

// ‚ùå WRONG: This will leak the resource if an error happens.
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const file = yield* acquireFile;

  // If this operation fails...
  yield* Effect.fail("Something went wrong!");

  // ...this line will never be reached, and the file will never be closed.
  yield* releaseFile;
});
```
