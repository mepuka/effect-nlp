# Create a Service Layer from a Managed Resource

## Guideline

Define a service using `class MyService extends Effect.Service(...)` and provide a `scoped` property in the implementation object. This property should be an `Effect` (typically from `Effect.acquireRelease`) that builds and releases the underlying resource.

## Rationale

This pattern is the key to building robust, testable, and leak-proof applications in Effect. It elevates a managed resource into a first-class service that can be used anywhere in your application. The `Effect.Service` helper simplifies defining the service's interface and context key. This approach decouples your business logic from the concrete implementation, as the logic only depends on the abstract service. The `Layer` declaratively handles the resource's entire lifecycle, ensuring it is acquired lazily, shared safely, and released automatically.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect, Console } from "effect";

// 1. Define the service interface
interface DatabaseService {
  readonly query: (sql: string) => Effect.Effect<string[], never, never>
}

// 2. Define the service implementation with scoped resource management
class Database extends Effect.Service<DatabaseService>()(
  "Database",
  {
    // The scoped property manages the resource lifecycle
    scoped: Effect.gen(function* () {
      const id = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);
      
      // Acquire the connection
      yield* Console.log(`[Pool ${id}] Acquired`);
      
      // Setup cleanup to run when scope closes
      yield* Effect.addFinalizer(() => 
        Console.log(`[Pool ${id}] Released`)
      );
      
      // Return the service implementation
      return {
        query: (sql: string) => Effect.sync(() => 
          [`Result for '${sql}' from pool ${id}`]
        )
      };
    })
  }
) {}

// 3. Use the service in your program
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const db = yield* Database;
  const users = yield* db.query("SELECT * FROM users");
  yield* Console.log(`Query successful: ${users[0]}`);
});

// 4. Run the program with scoped resource management
Effect.runPromise(
  Effect.scoped(program).pipe(
    Effect.provide(Database.Default)
  )
);

/*
Output:
[Pool 458] Acquired
Query successful: Result for 'SELECT * FROM users' from pool 458
[Pool 458] Released
*/
```

**Explanation:**
The `Effect.Service` helper creates the `Database` class with a `scoped` implementation. When `program` asks for the `Database` service, the Effect runtime creates a new connection pool, logs the acquisition, and automatically releases it when the scope closes. The `scoped` implementation ensures proper resource lifecycle management - the pool is acquired when first needed and released when the scope ends.

## Anti-Pattern

Creating and exporting a global singleton instance of a resource. This tightly couples your application to a specific implementation, makes testing difficult, and offers no guarantees about graceful shutdown.

```typescript
// ANTI-PATTERN: Global singleton
export const dbPool = makeDbPoolSync(); // Eagerly created, hard to test/mock

function someBusinessLogic() {
  // This function has a hidden dependency on the global dbPool
  return dbPool.query("SELECT * FROM products");
}
```
